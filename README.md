# rzy0901.github.io
+ This is my Personal Page based on [even](https://github.com/olOwOlo/hugo-theme-even).

+ Usage:

  + Do not use `hugo` with `sudo apt install hugo`, this version of `hugo` is not fully compactable with `mathjax` (`mathjax` is still unsupported for `hugo` until 2022/11/30).
  + Instead, use `hugo` with `goldmark-mathjax` support: <https://github.com/xjzsq/hugo>.
  + I also built binary files for `hugo` locally at <https://github.com/rzy0901/hugo/releases/tag/v1.0.0> for both windows and linux. You can use it with same usage of official `hugo`.
    + I also use [Github Action](https://github.com/features/actions) to deploy my website using my own built binary `hugo` file (See [build.yml](./.github/workflows/build.yml) for more details and github page is deployed on [gh-pages](https://github.com/rzy0901/rzy0901.github.io/tree/gh-pages) branch).
