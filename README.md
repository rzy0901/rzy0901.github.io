+ This is my Personal Page based on [even](https://github.com/olOwOlo/hugo-theme-even).

+ Compared with orignal [even](https://github.com/olOwOlo/hugo-theme-even), my theme added functions:

  1. Dark/Light mode.
  2. Solve Mathjax bug (quite important for latex users).
  3. Add "print the page as pdf" option (just enter a blog post, right click and select "print..." to have a try).
  4. Some other tiny changes such as excluding some posts from archives...

  I don't make a pull request to the original [even](https://github.com/olOwOlo/hugo-theme-even) since the owner seems to be disappeared. And my codes are a little messy that I do not have time to distinguish them into several independent commits.

+ Usage: take a look at blog post: <https://rzy0901.github.io/post/usage/>.
