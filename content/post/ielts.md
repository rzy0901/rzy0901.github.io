# Speaking

## Speaking Part 1

### Library

+ `Do you often go to the library？`

  Yes, I go to the library pretty often. After one day of lessons, I usually go to the library to finish my homework. Because I think library is a great and quiet place for me to focus on my homework and maximize my productivity.

+ `What do you usually do in the library？`

  I think this is uncertain. But most of time, I'll complete my homework or  do some course project in the library. Sometimes, I'll also borrow some books that related to my courses and research.

+ `Did you go to the library when you were a kid？`

  Yes, I went to the library when I was a kid.  When I was young, I went to library to borrow some story books. And I read both English and Chinese books. And this helps me a lot to improve vocabulary and grammar.

+ `Do Chinese kids often go to the library？`

  Yes, I think this is a quite often phenomenon for Chinese kids. For example, the library in my school is always packed and busy, especially when during the school's examination period. Young students often do their homework in the library. Sometime, they might borrow some books related to their courses or exams.

### Work or studies

+ `What subjects are you studying?`

  I'm now majoring in communication engineering. It is a very useful and practical subject since I need to do lots of work that highly related to real word, such as programming codes. 

+ `Do you like your subject?`

  Yes, definitely I love my subject. Because I have been dreaming to be an engineer since my childhood. And my major gives me lots of confidence and I feel like I'm getting closer to my dream.

+ `Why did you choose to study that subject?`

  I think the main reason is that I'm really interested in communication engineering. You know, the interest is always the best teacher. And I could also meet people share the same interest through selecting this subject.

+ `Is it very interesting?`

  Yes, it is of course very interesting. Communication Engineering mainly studies the modern way for information transmission. A typical real world application example is Wi-Fi, the wireless local network. You can regard my major as the basic connection layer of modern internet.

+ `Do you prefer to study in the morning or in the afternoon?`

  Well, I would like to study in the morning because I could feel more energetic in the morning after a good night's sleep.

+ `Are you looking forward to working?`

  Yeah. I'm looking forward to working. Because working could offer me a chance to turn my knowledge that learning at university into real practice.  And I'll also enjoy the feeling that I can get paid from what I love doing. 

+ `What technology do you use when you study?`

  Well, as far as I'm concerned, I'd like to write my notes online using a laptop, because I thinking electronic notes are easier to recap than hand notes after a long time.

+ `What work do you do?`

  I'm now currently a master student that majoring in communication engineering. So I'll probably become an engineer in the future.

+ `Why did you choose to do that type of job?`

  The most important reason is that I'm really interested in my major, communication engineering. So I am able to put the knowledge that I gained at university into practice. And also, this type of job is very well-paid.

+ `Do you like your job?`

  Yeah, I do like it. Because my job is highly related with mathematics and computer science. I think it is very challenging and interesting.

+ `Is it very interesting?`

  Yes, it is very interesting since it provides me an opportunity to convert abstract theory learnt at university or some other tiny inspirations into real-world practice. For example, some times I might program some codes to interpret some mathematical expressions. I really enjoy that process.

+ `Do you miss being a student?`

  Yes, I miss the period that I was an undergraduate student. Although at that time, I had heavy workload, I really enjoy the great studying atmosphere that I could learn new things and discuss new things everyday with classmates or teacher.

+ `What technology do you use at work?`

  To be honest, I think "online-meeting" app is the most frequently used technology for me at work. This offers me an opportunity that I only need to use a computer or a phone to send some work emails and then I can handle lots of things.

+ `Who helps you the most? And How?`

  Well, I think the person who helps me most is my tutor at university. He instructs me how to be a real researcher and do things that really make sense. I really appreciate him.
