# Why I set up such a Personal Website[^1]
[^1]:This website is based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and its theme [even](https://github.com/olOwOlo/hugo-theme-even), deploying on GitHub using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

+ Firstly, from the point of view as a student, I think it is necessary for me to build up a private place to `record and manage my notes `(or some other things) efficiently. In the past three years of my undergraduate student career, I could always dig some interesting ideas almost every day but not always had a chance (or a good 'util') to record them. For example, I learned lots of new things in the school every day and sometimes I might write some handwirtten notes  to record them.  But the fact is that I always dropped them in few days or throwed them in the trash because of poor readability in the next Semesters. Personal website offers me a direction to record my thoughts more fancily that maybe I shall still find my blogs useful and interesting even in many years later.
+ Secondly, on the other hand, as a researcher or a candidate persuing a job/degree, it's also important to set up some extra platform to `show your research interests or professional skills`, in addition to using a Curriculum Vitae (CV). And writing techical blogs seems to be one of the optimal solutions.
+ As far as I'm concerned, I had been planning for buidling up a personal website for a very long time. And this website is actually the third  version of my personal website. And during this process, I also helped my senior schoolmate 'Hawkyo' to use GitHub and build up a website: [HaoQiu Xiong](https://haoqiuxiong.github.io/). I am very proud of it. 
+ Of course, I also want to improve my English writing skills by writing blogs:smile:.

&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 首先，从一个学生的角度来看，我认为有必要建立一个“私人空间”来有效地记录和管理我的笔记（或其他一些东西）。在我过去三年的本科生生涯中，我几乎每天都能发现一些有趣的想法，但并不总是有机会（或有一个好的 "工具"）来记录它们。例如，我每天在学校学到很多新东西，有时我可能会写一些手写的笔记来记录它们。但事实上，我总是在几天内就把它们丢失，或者不再看它们（由于手写笔记的较差可读性）。个人网站为我提供了一个方向来解决这个问题，让我可以更“优雅地”地记录我的想法，并让我几年后重读我的笔记还会有一个很好的体验。
<br>    
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;其次，另一方面，作为一名研究人员或正在申请工作/学位的候选人，除了使用简历（Curriculum Vitae）之外，建立一些额外的平台来展示你的研究兴趣或专业技能也很重要。而撰写科技博客似乎是最佳的解决方案之一。
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;就我而言，我已经计划建立一个个人网站很长时间了。而这个网站实际上是我个人网站的第三个版本。在这个过程中，我还帮助我的学长 "Hawkyo "使用GitHub并建立了一个网站。我为这件事情感到非常自豪。
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;当然，我也想通过撰写博客提高我的英语写作能力。
