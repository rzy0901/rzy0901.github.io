## Brief Bio

+ I'm an undergradute student in the Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at **Southern University of Science and Technology** (**[SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/)**). I am currently studying in **LAb of WirelesS communications and System Optimization** (**[LASSO](https://eee.sustech.edu.cn/p/wangrui/About%20LASSO.html)**) and being supervised by **Prof. [Wang Rui](https://eee.sustech.edu.cn/p/wangrui/index.html)**.
+ I'm also currently working as an internship student in the **Integrated Sensing And Communication ([ISAC](https://www.ieee-isac.org/))** group in **Wireless Technology** (**WT**) LAB of Huawei Technology. My supervisor at the company is **Dr. [Tony Han Xiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=cqvSehcAAAAJ)**.
+ My research interest focuses on:
  1. Wireless Communication.
  2. Integrated Sensing And Communication (ISAC).
